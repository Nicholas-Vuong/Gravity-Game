# Gravity-Game
Objective: Create a playable game that allows the player to control the direction of gravity in order to allow a character to travel through unique game levels to an end destination.
• Worked with the Unity Physics Engine in order to adjust the player character's velocity, acceleration, and collisions with other game objects. 
• Designed unique game levels by using Scenes, Tile maps, and game objects in order to make each level have a different layout and implement new variables into the game.
• Coded Scripts for each game object to ensure that all moving parts worked harmoniously and that the game was able to function correctly. 
• Implemented Animations into different obstacles that were placed throughout each level.
